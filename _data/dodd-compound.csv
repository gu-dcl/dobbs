achebe_pfp,,achebe_pfp.jpg,,,"Achebe, Chinua",Student B,1930; 2013,,"Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist and poet most well known for his first novel <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, its sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, and his fifth novel <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>. Achebe’s first novel is the most widely read and translated African novel of all time, which earned him the title of father of modern African literature. Achebe received several literary awards during his lifetime, including the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize and the Man Booker International Prize in 2007. Achebe’s writing heavily criticizes westernization and British colonialism in Nigeria, as well as inaccurate and racist depictions of Africa in western literature.<br/><br/>

He is also not afraid to criticize Africans on their lack of resistance against colonialism. In <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Achebe tells the story of Okonkwo, who finds himself fighting against British missionaries and colonists in his village. When he suggests that they fight back, and he does by beheading a messenger, no one else fights with him. He quickly realizes he is one of the only ones resisting colonialism and conversion. In the sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, Okonkwo’s grandson Obi, struggles with his Igbo identity as he becomes more westernized. He is tried in a colonial court for taking a bribe, a similar commentary on the fact that straying away from his Igbo traditions for western beliefs led to his corruption.","Authors, Nigerian; Igbo (African People); ","Ogidi, Nigeria",6.15,6.866667,,,Still Image,image/jpg,en,,
anansi_pfp,,anansi_pfp.jpg,,,Anansi,Student A,,,"Kwaku Anansi is the spider God and a major trickster character in Ghanaian folklore and mythology originally from the Asante people of the Akan ethnic group. Anansi is depicted as a man with eight legs who triumphs over more powerful adversaries by utilizing his wits and cunning nature. His cunningness inspires the Akan word – Anansesem, which describes a story too incredible to believe. In Gold Coast mythology, Anansi is the creator of the world and plays the role of a cultural hero who accomplishes impossible tasks like stealing the sun. Anansi tales were spread throughout the globe through transatlantic slave trade. He entered American folklore as Brer Rabbit and holds space in Western pop culture as Marvel’s Spiderman. Anansi tales are also fundamental to Caribbean folklore, especially Jamaican lore. African slaves in the U.S. regarded, the Anansi inspired character, Brer Rabbit as a resistance figure whose use of brains over brawn empowered slaves to undermine and challenge the plantation regimes.<br/><br/>

Anansi’s versatile stories and characters were shaped, reimagined, and retold throughout the years by people across the globe. Traditional Anansi tales live on through oral story telling in West Africa and Asansi tales are highlighted to varying degrees in contemporary African literature. Contemporary authors call on Anansi folklore to reemphasize the importance of Anansi tales or to comment on lessons of the past. In <em>Anansi and The Golden Pot</em> by Taiye Selasi, an American Ghanian author, Anansi the boy visits his grandmother back in Ghana. Through his encounters with Anansi the spider, he learns of the relationship between greed and kindness. This modern children’s story beautifully retells and introduces the tradition of Anansi to a new generation.<br/><br/>

Many western authors contribute to the original tales of Anansi. Anansi’s character is represented in many works of art and literature, from graphic art to plays. <em>Anansi Boys</em> by Neil Gaiman was published in 2005 and is currently being produced as a short Amazon Prime video series. This story features the Anansi inspired character Mr. Nancy whose story is revealed through the journey of his two children’s folklore-filled adventures. As Anansi’s character is passed along through oral traditions, literature, and media, a common thread of values and inspiration is preserved in each encounter. Anansi’s spider-like manifestation and essential message of overcoming life with wit, made it easy for people across the world to embrace the Ghanian trickster.",Anansi (Legendary character)--Legends; Folklore--Ghana; Akan (African People) ,Ghana,5.555,-0.1925,,,Still Image,image/jpg,en,,
apartheid_pfp,,apartheid_pfp.jpg,,,Apartheid,Student A,1948; 1990,,"The Apartheid refers to the social system enacted by the South African government in 1948. Literally meaning “apartness,” this system seeked to separate the different racial groups in South Africa by drastic institutionalized racism. There was a facade of equality and freedom, but the policies implemented into the law made this impossible. Instead, segregation, classism, and racism became the center of the government. This caste-like system upheld white power while simultaneously pinning people of color at the bottom of the social hierarchy, making social mobility and escaping this system impossible. In 1950, The Population Registration Act was passed, forcing all South Africans to register their race. The Group Areas Act physically separated people based on their race, even going as far as displacing people of color from their homes into neglected areas with other people of color. Black people were forced to rent this property, there were no opportunities to own property. There was an illusion of every thing being separated but equal. However, people of color were far from their culture, workplaces, had little opportunity, and were not allowed to go into areas where white people were, so everything was separate and unequal. Other acts were passed to prevent interracial marriage and any type of sexual relations between races.<br/><br/>

At the center of many of Lebogang Mashile’s works is the apartheid. Her family was exiled during the Apartheid, and when she returned to South Africa after the Apartheid, the effects were still prevalent. Much to her despair, the damage was evident and the people are still rebuilding their lives and relationships with “freedom.” Mashile highlights this feeling in her poem “Insider Outsider.” She describes her home country being a foreign land full of empty promises. The people are left with the scars and no one else seems to understand. Black people are considered outsiders in their own home land because white people wanted to preserve their power at the cost of black people. She describes feeling tired of being different, feeling helpless, and how she will forever carry the scars of the Apartheid. However, she knew she was in control of her destiny. It may be easier to dwell and resent the past injustice, but she chose to take it upon herself to discover her worth and empower other South Africans to do the same. Even if society does not support this, unity and determination will prevail.",Apartheid; South Africa--Race relations;,South Africa,-29.695,24.387,,,Still Image,image/jpg,en,,

Tha main characters were four brothers Ikenna, Boja, Ovembe, and Benjamin. They enjoy fishing in the Ala River even though their parents do not allow them to because the water is extremely polluted.

After accidentally shooting a tribal leader’s son, Okownko is exiled for seven years to his mother’s native village. During his time there, Okonkwo experiences the arrival of British missionaries that attempt to convert and colonize his people. They live mostly in peace until the arrival of Reverend James Smith, a much more strict and prejudiced man. After an Igbo convert named Enoch unmasks a village leader representing an ancestral spirit during a sacred ceremony, the church and compound are burned in retaliation.<br/><br/>

The village leaders are then arrested by the British, but when they are released Okonkwo suggests that they fight back during a meeting, expecting them to agree.
