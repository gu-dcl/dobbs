soueif_pfp,soueif_pfp.jpg,,"Soueif, Ahdaf (1950-)",image/jpg,"Ahdaf Soueif is an extremely prevalent author from the country of Egypt, born in Cairo. Some of her most popular novels include <em>The Eye of the Sun</em> which was published in 1993 and her most famous novel <em>The Map of Love</em> published in 1999 selling over one million copies. Soueif has quite a bit of variety in her writing, she writes both novels and short stories as well as fiction and nonfiction. The <em>The Eye of the Sun</em> was a fictional story about a Young Egyptian woman named Asya, who was coming of age finding her comfort and grounding herself in her passion of art. Ahdaf’s style and focus is primarily on Egyptian culture, history, and politics. This should not come as a surprise considering she is also an activist and has written for the Guardian as a political commentator throughout the Egyptian Revolution. She even wrote about her own experience in the Egyptian Revolution in 2012 titled <em>Cairo: My City, Our Revolution</em>. Ahdaf is also the founding chair of the Palestine Festival of Literature in 2008. Throughout her time, she has written countless novels and short stories that have been published by well-known companies and organizations leading her to become very successful winning awards such as Inaugural Mahmoud Darwish Award, Cavafy Award and was named in The Guardian′s Books Power 100.",,,1950-03-23,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
