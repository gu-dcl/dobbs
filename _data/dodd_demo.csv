achebe_pfp,achebe_pfp.jpg,,"Achebe, Chinua (1930-2013)",image/jpg,"Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian novelist and poet most well known for his first novel <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, its sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, and his fifth novel <em>Anthills of the Savannah</em>. Achebe’s first novel is the most widely read and translated African novel of all time, which earned him the title of father of modern African literature. Achebe received several literary awards during his lifetime, including the first Commonwealth Poetry Prize and the Man Booker International Prize in 2007. Achebe’s writing heavily criticizes westernization and British colonialism in Nigeria, as well as inaccurate and racist depictions of Africa in western literature.<br/><br/>

He is also not afraid to criticize Africans on their lack of resistance against colonialism. In <em>Things Fall Apart</em>, Achebe tells the story of Okonkwo, who finds himself fighting against British missionaries and colonists in his village. When he suggests that they fight back, and he does by beheading a messenger, no one else fights with him. He quickly realizes he is one of the only ones resisting colonialism and conversion. In the sequel <em>No Longer at Ease</em>, Okonkwo’s grandson Obi, struggles with his Igbo identity as he becomes more westernized. He is tried in a colonial court for taking a bribe, a similar commentary on the fact that straying away from his Igbo traditions for western beliefs led to his corruption.",Student A,,1930/2013,,biographic photo,"Authors, NIgerian; Nigerian literature ( English); ",Nigeria,6.15,6.866667,thingsfall_pfp; ,,,,,,,,Still Image,eng,

The <em>The Eye of the Sun</em> was a fictional story about a Young Egyptian woman named Asya, who was coming of age finding her comfort and grounding herself in her passion of art. Ahdaf’s style and focus is primarily on Egyptian culture, history, and politics. This should not come as a surprise considering she is also an activist and has written for the Guardian as a political commentator throughout the Egyptian Revolution. She even wrote about her own experience in the Egyptian Revolution in 2012 titled <em>Cairo: My City, Our Revolution</em>. Ahdaf is also the founding chair of the Palestine Festival of Literature in 2008.

thingsfall_pfp,thingsfall_pfp.jpg,,<em>Things Fall Apart</em> (1958),image/jpg,"First published in 1958, the novel recounts the story of Okonkwo, an Igbo wrestler that rose to power as a leader of the Umuofia villages. After accidentally shooting a tribal leader’s son, Okownko is exiled for seven years to his mother’s native village. During his time there, Okonkwo experiences the arrival of British missionaries that attempt to convert and colonize his people. They live mostly in peace until the arrival of Reverend James Smith, a much more strict and prejudiced man. After an Igbo convert named Enoch unmasks a village leader representing an ancestral spirit during a sacred ceremony, the church and compound are burned in retaliation.<br/><br/>

The village leaders are then arrested by the British, but when they are released Okonkwo suggests that they fight back during a meeting, expecting them to agree. Okwonko kills a messenger but then quickly realizes that his fellow leaders will not fight with him. Before being tried by a colonial court, Okonkwo hangs himself, something that is considered a sin. The novel is praised for its criticism of British colonialism through the perspective of an African person, and is regarded as an accurate depiction of Igbo culture. It remains the most widely studied and translated African novel of all time, and was one of the first African novels to be critically acclaimed worldwide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
